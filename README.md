# UI/UX DESIGN 
## BOOKING APP : BLACK ESSENCE 

Black essence is a hair and beauty booking platform connecting proffessionals with customers.

### PROBLEM STATEMENT 
 It is important that while small business may depend highly on social media plateforms to book clients , the harsh relaity is that if any of these plateforms were to crash at any point many businesses will be disconnected from their customers and followers on that social media plateform. We saw an example of this in october where Instagram , facebook & whatsapp crashed for a while ehich lead to many businesses losing money.
 
### what problem is this booking plateform solving?
- hair and beauty proffessionals are able to reach potential clients that may not use social media plateforms like instagram. 
- People who are visiting the UK on holiday will find it easier to find hair and beauty services.
